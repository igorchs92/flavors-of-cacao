                            Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world.
                            Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds.
                            However, not all chocolate bars are created equal!

                            In this project we are going to look at what makes a great chocolate.
                            The visualizations contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars,
                            along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa,
                            the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.
                        </p>

                            The information was compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society.

                        In order to have a better understanding of where and in what frequency the chocolates tastings found place,
                        we have visualized the total amount of ratings for every location. The box-plot below shows an overall trend in the amount of ratings given per country.

                        With this information, we can conclude that by far, the most ratings found place in the U.S.A.,
                        with an astounding amount of 764 ratings. Amongst the runner ups were France with 156 ratings, Canada with 125 ratings, and the U.K. with 96 ratings.

                    <p class="medium">
                        One of the most interesting things that I have found in the data, is the trend in ratings over the years.
                        If we look at the box and whiskers chart below, we can clearly tell that there are multiple trends going on.
                    </p>

                    <p class="medium with extra margin">
                        Given the information, we can conclude that the ratings have been slightly increasing over the years, and that
                        the deviation in between ratings has been declining.
                        There might be several reasons for why we might be seeing this type of trend,
                        however due to uncertainty of why we are seeing this trend, we will leave that to your imagination.

                            Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective
                            interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch.
                            Batch numbers, vintages and review dates are included in the data when known.

                            Based on our findings we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between ratings and the year it was reviewed.
                            Also did we see that most of the ratings were conducted in the U.S.A.,
                            this might have something to do with the country of residence of the reviewer.
                            And finally, if you took a look at the Tableau charts of this project,
                            you might have noticed that there is a down trend between ratings and high percentages of cacao in the chocolates.
