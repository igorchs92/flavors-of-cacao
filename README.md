# Flavors of Cacao

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world.
Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds.
However, not all chocolate bars are created equal!

With this project, I am making a complete analysis of which trends make chocolate bars get
higher ratings. The visualizations contains expert ratings of
over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with
information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean
used and where the beans were grown.

The information was compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. For up-to-date information, as well as additional content (including interviews with craft chocolate makers), please visit his website: [Flavors of Cacao - Home](http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html).
